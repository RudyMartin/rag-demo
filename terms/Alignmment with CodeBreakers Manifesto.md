# ✅ CodeBreakers Alignment Summary – Colab RAG Demo

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Colab and OpenAI APIs. The script has been modified to align with the values of the **CodeBreakers Manifesto**. Below is a summary of how each chapter is reflected in this educational tool.

## 🔓 Chapter 1: Breaking Free from Data Silos

* Loads public markdown and text files from open GitHub repositories
* Uses plain-text formats to ensure maximum accessibility

## 🧠 Chapter 2: Ethical AI

* Prompts explicitly prevent hallucination: "Answer based only on the provided context."
* Users can view the full prompt sent to the LLM
* Answer generation includes a transparency warning

## 🌐 Chapter 3: Decentralized Control

* Encourages learners to replace OpenAI with open-source models (e.g., Hugging Face + `transformers`)
* Keeps data local to the Colab notebook – no third-party analytics

## 🙋 Chapter 4: User Empowerment

* Enables hands-on use in Colab without server dependencies
* Adds options to view source chunks and debug mode for learning

## 🌱 Chapter 5: Sustainable Innovation

* Lightweight: runs in free-tier Colab
* Designed for reuse and remixing in other educational settings

## 🧾 Chapter 6: Accountability and Amends

* Prompts and code discourage misuse or overconfidence in LLM output
* Outputs are visible and reproducible

## 🎓 Chapter 7: Education and Training

* Teaches foundational RAG concepts: chunking, retrieval, prompting
* Uses readable, modifiable Python code with comments
* Notebook supports inquiry, debugging, and student-driven exploration

## 📂 Recommended Repo Practice

* Place this alignment summary in `/docs/` or `/terms/`
* Include the full `CodeBreakers_Manifesto.md` in `/terms/`
* Add a `README.md` badge or section linking to this summary
